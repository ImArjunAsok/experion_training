Asynchronous programming makes it possible to express waiting for long-running actions
without freezing the program during these actions. JavaScript environments typically 
implement this style of programming using callbacks, functions that are called when the
actions complete. An event loop schedules such callbacks to be called when appropriate, 
one after the other, so that their execution does not overlap.

callback - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function. This technique allows a 
function to call another function. A callback function can run after another function has finished.

promise - one time process
